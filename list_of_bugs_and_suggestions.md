## Retool's list of bugs & suggestions:

1. Cannot resize an image vertically (I’m not sure if this is intentionally designed since other components can be resized vertically).

2. Comment mode: if the comment mode is turned on by Retool developers, allow users in the preview mode to right click to a component and add comments on improvements they want for that component => Faster feedback loop between Retool developers & end users => better users experience.

3. The https://login.retool.com/auth/login page should direct users directly to the home page `https://[organization_name].retool.com/` if they have logged in (or is this intentionally designed so?)

4. The login state should sync to Retool Docs (https://docs.retool.com) and Retool Template (https://retool.com/templates/) pages. On the top right corner of those pages, we should display a button as go to home instead of `Sign in` and `Start for free` which after clicking onto those buttons, users have to enter their credentials again while they already logged in.

5. Retool marketplace: For sophisticated templates that people upload in showcase, we should allow them to charge money for it (I’m thinking about a new generation of Retool developers, just like what we have with ServiceNow developers or Microsoft Visual Basic developers).
